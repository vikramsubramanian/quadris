Bonus Features:
To enable bonus features, you can enter the command "enablebonus" at any time during the game, similar to how you enter any other game command. To disable bonus features, you can enter the command "disablebonus". The default is that bonus features are disabled.

rename commands: To rename any existing command, you may enter "rename [old command] [new command]", ensuring they are space separated (e.g. rename counterclockwise cc). The constraints on the new name is that they may not be a prefix of any other existing command (other than the command it is replacing), as the command will not be properly identified in this case. 

ability to replace special brown block with any block: we could easily add another level that replaces the brown block dropped in level 4 with any type of block. This would be dropped after every 5 drops if there is no row cleared.
